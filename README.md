### Maps Included

1. **Base Map**: A foundational map highlighting geographical features with a monochrome color scheme for clarity and contrast against thematic layers.
2. **Hospital Locations**: This map layer displays the locations of hospitals in Seattle, providing essential information on healthcare facilities.
3. **Data**: The basemap plus the theme layer from the preceding two tiles make up the layer group that this tile represents. For this tile, zoom layers 3 through 14 are accessible.
4. **UW-theme**: This tile is a map layer I designed on MapBox. Furthermore, this tile shows the UW theme with a variety of different colors which represent UW like purple. The available zoom layers for this tile would be from 3-14.
